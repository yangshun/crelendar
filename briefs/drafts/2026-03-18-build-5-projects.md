# Build These 5 Projects and Get Yourself Hired

- **Date:** 2026-03-18
- **Topic:** 5 targeted portfolio projects that map directly to front-end interview rounds
- **Pillar:** 💼 Career / Interview Preparation
- **Format:** Carousel
- **Format rationale:** 5 distinct projects, each needing its own slide for skills and technical details. Carousel supports the numbered list + reveal structure that drives saves. Previous post was a carousel (React vs Vue) and the one before was also carousel (TypeScript). Format variety is strained, but 5 projects with distinct content per slide mechanically require carousel. 7 slides (hook + 5 projects + CTA).
- **Key angle:** These aren't random projects. Each one maps to a specific front-end interview round (machine coding, system design, performance, accessibility). 5 targeted projects beat 15 tutorial clones.
- **GFE tie-in:** CTA slide + caption link to GFE Projects page (80% free).
- **Design inspiration:** Nikki Siapno career content style - clean numbered list, icon per project, structured layout
- **Color theme:** Light (white/cream bg)
- **Accent color:** GFE brand colors. Each project could have a subtle color accent (blue for dashboard, green for e-commerce, etc.).

## LinkedIn Caption
Stop building 15 tutorial clones. Build 5 projects that each prove you can pass a specific interview round.

Hiring managers spend about 30 seconds on your portfolio. A weather app and a Netflix clone won't survive that window. But an e-commerce page with optimized Core Web Vitals, a dashboard with cross-filtering, or a design system with keyboard navigation? That tells them you've built production-level code.

Each project here maps to a real front-end interview round. Machine coding, system design, accessibility, performance - cover all 5 and you've demonstrated the full stack of skills interviewers actually test.

Which project would you build first?

- Style notes: Clean, scannable. Each project slide follows the same 3-bullet layout.

## Slide 3 — Project 2: Analytics Dashboard
**Headline:** 2. Analytics Dashboard

- **Senior-level:** Compound patterns (Tabs, Accordion), controlled + uncontrolled modes, Testing Library tests, Storybook for every state
- **The challenge:** Build a Select with keyboard nav, screen readers, and async options
**Visual direction:**
- Layout: Same 3-bullet layout. "Machine Coding" interview badge.
- Key elements: Component/puzzle icon. "Senior-level component design" highlight.

**Planned first comment:** "The project most candidates skip: the component library (#4). Building a Select component with keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and async options is the single hardest machine coding challenge — and it's exactly what separates senior from mid-level in interviews. If you can only build one project from this list, build that one.
