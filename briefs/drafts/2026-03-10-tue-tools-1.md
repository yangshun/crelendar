# AI Is Making You Faster — and 17% Worse at Coding

- **Date:** 2026-03-10
- **Topic:** Anthropic's peer-reviewed study found AI coding assistance reduces developer skill mastery by 17%. But the fix is in the interaction pattern, not in ditching AI. Three specific patterns preserve learning while keeping the speed.
- **Pillar:** 📰 News
- **Format:** Carousel
- **Format rationale:** First post in the new "Ship with AI" series (replacing Tue Tools). Carousel fits because the content has a clear progression: provocative stat → why it happens → the fix (3 interaction patterns) → CTA. 4 content slides + hook + CTA = 6 slides. Single image wouldn't capture the progression from problem to solution.
- **Key angle:** Anthropic's own research shows AI coding tools reduce mastery by 17%. But developers who use AI for "conceptual inquiry" (asking why, requesting explanations) scored 65-86%, while those who just delegated scored 24-39%. The fix isn't less AI — it's better AI interaction patterns.
- **GFE tie-in:** CTA slide + caption link to GFE front-end interview handbook. Natural tie-in: if AI is making you worse at coding, you need deliberate practice for interviews.
- **Design inspiration:** Clean, data-forward layout. Stats as large callout numbers. The Pragmatic Engineer style for industry research content.
- **Color theme:** Dark (navy/black bg)
- **Accent color:** Red/orange for the "warning" stat, green for the "fix" slides. Anthropic brand orange as secondary accent.

## LinkedIn Caption
Anthropic just published a peer-reviewed study on AI coding tools. The headline: 17% lower skill mastery with AI assistance.

But the actual paper is wilder than the headline. Three findings nobody's talking about:

1. AI didn't actually make participants faster. The speed difference was NOT statistically significant. They spent up to 30% of their session just composing queries.
2. Senior devs with 7+ years suffered the same skill degradation as juniors. Experience didn't protect them.
3. 38.5% of AI users finished with zero errors vs. 7.7% of the control group. The AI users never encountered the mistakes that drive learning.

The most interesting part: developers who pasted AI code, then spent ~2 extra minutes asking "why does this work?" scored 65%+ vs. 24-39% for pure delegators. Same code, same AI — completely different outcomes.

# CONTENT BRIEF — Format A: Carousel
# ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Slide 1 — Hook
**Title:** AI Is Making You 17% Worse at Coding
**Subtitle:** Anthropic's own research says so. Here's the fix.
**Visual direction:**
- Layout: Large title centered, dark bg. "17%" as a massive stat number, partially behind the title text. Subtitle below in smaller type.
- Key elements: GreatFrontEnd logo top. "Ship with AI" series badge. The "17%" stat as dominant visual element.
- Style notes: Dark bg, red/orange accent on the percentage. Alarming but not clickbait — the subtitle immediately signals there's a solution.

## Slide 2 — The Study
**Headline:** The Largest RCT on AI Coding Skills
- Anthropic (yes, the company selling AI tools) ran a randomized controlled trial with professional developers.
- Developers WITH AI assistance scored 17% lower on skill mastery assessments than the control group.
- The more developers relied on AI for direct code generation, the worse they performed independently.
- Published January 30, 2026. Peer-reviewed on arXiv.
**Visual direction:**
- Layout: Headline top. Key stat "17% lower mastery" in a large callout box. Below: simplified study design diagram (Group A: with AI → tested → scored lower | Group B: without AI → tested → scored higher).
- Key elements: Study stat callout, simplified A/B group diagram, "Peer-reviewed" badge.
- Style notes: Dark bg, data-visualization aesthetic. The stat should feel authoritative, not sensational.

## Slide 3 — Why It Happens
**Headline:** Delegation vs. Understanding
- When you accept AI-generated code without understanding it, you skip the learning loop that builds mastery.
- The study identified a critical split: **delegation mode** (paste error, accept fix, move on) vs. **inquiry mode** (ask why, request explanations, understand before accepting).
- Delegation mode mastery scores: **24-39%**
- Inquiry mode mastery scores: **65-86%**
**Visual direction:**
- Layout: Headline top. Two-column comparison: Left column "Delegation Mode" with red accent showing the low score range. Right column "Inquiry Mode" with green accent showing the high score range. Brief behavior examples under each.
- Key elements: Two-column contrast, score ranges as large numbers, red vs. green color coding.
- Style notes: The contrast is the story. Make the score gap visually dramatic.

## Slide 4 — The Non-Obvious Findings
**Headline:** 3 Things the Study Found That Nobody Expected
- **1. AI didn't actually make you faster.** The speed difference was NOT statistically significant. Participants spent up to 11 minutes (30% of their session) composing queries. The "speed-accuracy tradeoff" framing is wrong — there was no reliable speed benefit to trade away.
- **2. Senior devs suffered the same degradation as juniors.** 7+ year veterans showed the same learning gap as 1-3 year devs. Experience provided zero protection when learning something new.
- **3. Debugging was disproportionately destroyed.** 38.5% of AI users finished with zero errors vs. 7.7% of the control group. The AI group never developed the pattern-matching that comes from hitting errors and fixing them. Error prevention is learning prevention.
**Visual direction:**
- Layout: Headline top. Three numbered findings, each with a key stat highlighted. Amber/yellow accent — this is the "surprising" slide, not red (problem) or green (solution).
- Key elements: "NOT statistically faster" callout, "7+ year veterans — same gap" callout, "38.5% vs 7.7% zero-error rate" contrast.
- Style notes: This slide should make the audience say "wait, really?" The data should contradict assumptions — especially finding #1 (most people assume AI at least makes you faster).

## Slide 5 — The One Behavior That Flipped Everything
**Headline:** 2 Minutes of "Why Does This Work?" Changed Everything
- The study identified 6 interaction patterns. The most striking: **"Generation-Then-Comprehension"** — developers who pasted AI code, then asked "why does this work?" scored 65%+ vs. 24-39% for pure delegators.
- The behavioral difference was shockingly small: ~2 extra minutes of follow-up questions AFTER pasting. Same code. Same AI. Completely different outcomes.
- But here's the catch: the study also found that **explanation-heavy AI use STILL degraded learning** overall. 79 of 130 total queries were explanation requests — and the group still scored 17% lower. Asking "why" helps, but it doesn't fully close the gap vs. no AI at all.
**Visual direction:**
- Layout: Headline top. A horizontal spectrum showing all 6 interaction patterns from lowest to highest scores: AI Delegation (24-39%) → Progressive Reliance → Iterative Debugging → Generation-Then-Comprehension (65%+) → Hybrid Code-Explanation → Conceptual Inquiry (65-86%). Highlight the "Generation-Then-Comprehension" pattern with a callout showing "~2 min difference."
- Key elements: 6-pattern spectrum visualization, "2 minutes" callout, the catch stat (79/130 queries were explanations, still -17%).
- Style notes: This slide gives a genuinely actionable insight — but also an honest caveat. The audience should leave with a specific behavior change AND realistic expectations about its limits.

## Final Slide — CTA
**Headline:** Ship with AI — Follow for More
**GFE copy:** Practical AI coding tips for engineering teams. Follow GreatFrontEnd for weekly tips.
**CTA button text:** Share This Post & Follow Us!
**Visual direction:**
- Layout: Headline centered. GFE logo prominent. "Ship with AI" series branding.
- Key elements: GFE logo, series badge, CTA text.
- Style notes: Dark bg consistent with series. Clean, minimal.

**Target:** 6 slides (Hook + 4 content + CTA). First post in the Ship with AI series.

**Planned first comment:** "One detail from the study that didn't fit in the carousel: during pilot testing, 25-35% of control group participants kept finding ways to sneak AI use even when explicitly told not to. If developers can't stop using AI even in a controlled experiment, the skill degradation problem is going to get worse before it gets better. The fix from the study is surprisingly small — spending just 2 extra minutes asking 'why does this work?' after pasting AI code flipped mastery scores from the bottom tier (24-39%) to 65%+. Same code, same AI, completely different learning outcome. If you want to sharpen the fundamentals AI is eroding, practicing with real interview questions is one of the most effective ways to do it: https://www.greatfrontend.com/front-end-interview-guidebook?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=ship-with-ai-1_mar+2026.
