# Stop Vibe Coding. Start Agentic Engineering.

- **Date:** 2026-03-24
- **Topic:** The shift from "vibe coding" to "agentic engineering." But the real story isn't the label — it's the specific failure modes vibe coding creates (assumption propagation, comprehension debt, the 80% problem) and the concrete workflow artifacts that agentic engineering uses to prevent them (declarative specs with test gates, fresh-context self-review, the `agents.md` pattern).
- **Pillar:** 📰 News
- **Format:** Carousel
- **Format rationale:** Ship with AI series post #2. Carousel fits because the content progresses from problem (5 failure modes) → deep dive (80% problem) → fix (imperative→declarative shift) → patterns (agents.md, fresh-context review) → proof with caveats (stats, Cloudflare, Salesforce). 9 slides (hook + 7 content + CTA). Each slide carries one idea at scannable density.
- **Key angle:** "Vibe coding" isn't just sloppy — it creates five specific failure modes (assumption propagation, abstraction bloat, dead code accumulation, sycophantic agreement, comprehension debt). Agentic engineering prevents them with concrete artifacts: declarative specs with test gates, fresh-context AI self-review, and the `agents.md` pattern (require the agent to ask questions before coding). The proof isn't "more PRs" — it's that teams shipping 98% more PRs also spend 91% longer reviewing each one, which means the bottleneck shifted from writing to verification.
- **GFE tie-in:** CTA slide + caption link to GFE front-end interview handbook. Natural tie-in: agentic engineering requires deep fundamentals — you can't review AI code or write specs if you don't understand the domain. Osmani explicitly says it "disproportionately benefits senior engineers" with strong fundamentals.
- **Design inspiration:** Clean workflow diagrams. The Pragmatic Engineer style for process content. Before/after split layouts.
- **Color theme:** Dark (navy/black bg)
- **Accent color:** Red for "vibe coding" (the anti-pattern), green for "agentic engineering" (the fix). Subtle purple/blue for workflow diagrams.

## LinkedIn Caption
Addy Osmani just named the thing most of us are doing wrong with AI coding tools.

"Vibe coding" creates five specific failure modes. The worst one: assumption propagation — the model misunderstands something early and builds entire features on faulty premises. You don't find out until you're five PRs deep and the architecture is cemented.

His alternative — "agentic engineering" — has one rule that changes everything: instead of telling the AI HOW to code ("write a function that takes X..."), you tell it WHAT must be true ("here are requirements, tests that must pass, success criteria — figure out how").

But here's the stat nobody talks about: teams using this workflow merge 98% more PRs, but review time per PR increased 91% and PR size increased 154%. AI didn't eliminate the bottleneck. It moved it from writing to reviewing.

What's been your experience — has AI actually made your team ship faster end-to-end?

# CONTENT BRIEF — Format A: Carousel
# ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Slide 1 — Hook
**Title:** Stop Vibe Coding. Start Agentic Engineering.
**Subtitle:** The AI workflow top engineers are switching to.
**Visual direction:**
- Layout: Large title centered, dark bg. "Vibe Coding" crossed out in red, "Agentic Engineering" highlighted in green below it. Subtitle below.
- Key elements: GreatFrontEnd logo top. "Ship with AI" series badge. Crossed-out vs. highlighted text creates instant visual tension.
- Style notes: Dark bg. The red/green contrast tells the story before anyone reads a word.

## Slide 2 — The 5 Failure Modes of Vibe Coding
**Headline:** Vibe Coding Creates 5 Failure Modes
- **1. Assumption Propagation** — wrong premise, 5 PRs deep before you notice
- **2. Abstraction Bloat** — 1,000 lines where 100 would work
- **3. Comprehension Debt** — tests pass, can't explain it 3 days later
- **4. Sycophantic Agreement** — AI never says "are you sure?"
- **5. The 80% Problem** — "almost right, but not quite" (66% of devs)
**Visual direction:**
- Format: Icon list — each failure mode is a bold name + one short phrase. No full sentences.
- Layout: Headline top, red accent. Five numbered items as a compact list. "66%" as stat callout at bottom.
- Style notes: Each item is ONE LINE. The audience should recognize 2-3 of these from their own experience. ~45 words total.

## Slide 3 — The 80% Problem
**Headline:** The Last 20% Is Where It Collapses
- AI gets you 80% there. The last 20% — edge cases, integration, production — requires the understanding you skipped.
- "Debugging AI code takes longer than writing it myself" — 45% of devs (Stack Overflow 2025)
- Only 16% report "great" productivity gains from AI.
**Visual direction:**
- Format: Stat slide — large "80/20" split graphic.
- Layout: "80/20" as dominant visual (80% green fading to 20% red). Two stats as callouts below.
- Style notes: This slide makes the audience feel the gap between the promise and the reality. ~40 words.

## Slide 4 — The Fix: Imperative → Declarative
**Headline:** Tell AI WHAT Must Be True, Not HOW to Code
- **Imperative** (red): "Write a function that takes X and returns Y. Use this library. Handle these edge cases."
- **Declarative** (green): "Here are requirements. Tests that must pass. Success criteria. Figure out how."
**Visual direction:**
- Format: Side-by-side comparison — two prompt examples, nothing else.
- Layout: Two columns, red vs. green. Prompt text IS the content. No explanations underneath — the contrast speaks for itself.
- Style notes: The audience should be able to copy the declarative pattern and use it immediately. ~35 words.

## Slide 5 — Two Patterns to Try Today
**Headline:** Two Patterns You Can Use Today
- **agents.md:** Add a project file requiring AI to ask questions BEFORE coding and generate an implementation plan BEFORE execution. Prevents assumption propagation.
- **Fresh-context review:** After AI generates code, open a new chat with the same model to critique it. Catches its own mistakes without the original conversation biasing it.
**Visual direction:**
- Format: Two callout boxes stacked vertically.
- Layout: Green accent. Each box has bold pattern name + 1-line description.
- Style notes: These are the actionable takeaways. The audience leaves with two things they can try today. ~45 words.

## Slide 6 — The Hidden Trade-Off
**Headline:** 98% More PRs — But Read the Fine Print
- Teams merge 98% more PRs with heavy AI adoption (Faros AI / DORA 2025).
- But: review time per PR up 91%. PR size up 154%.
- 99% save 10+ hours/week — most report NO decrease in overall workload (Atlassian).
**Visual direction:**
- Format: Stat contrast card.
- Layout: "98%" as large green stat. "91%" and "154%" as contrasting red/amber stats below. "No decrease in workload" as highlighted caveat.
- Style notes: The contrast is the story — bigger output, bigger review burden, no net time savings. ~40 words.

## Slide 7 — Cloudflare: $1,100 for 800+ AI Sessions
**Headline:** $1,100 for 800+ AI Sessions
- One engineer rebuilt Next.js on Vite. 4.4x faster builds. 57% smaller bundles.
- Why it worked: Next.js is exhaustively documented, has thousands of pre-existing E2E tests.
- Key: first hours spent defining architecture as the "north star" — not prompting.
**Visual direction:**
- Format: Case study card — logo + stat + lesson.
- Layout: Cloudflare logo top-left. "$1,100" as hero stat. "North star architecture" as callout.
- Style notes: This is agentic engineering in practice — the spec-first approach made 800 sessions coherent. ~40 words.

## Slide 8 — Salesforce: When Agents Go Rogue
**Headline:** 90%+ Adoption — After the Agents Went Rogue
- Cursor across all Salesforce engineering clouds. Cut legacy coverage time by 85%.
- First attempt: agents "went rogue, modifying hundreds of files at once."
- Fix: "one class at a time" + Sonarqube gate. AI tests uncovered a prod bug humans missed.
**Visual direction:**
- Format: Case study card — logo + stat + lesson.
- Layout: Salesforce logo top-left. "85% faster" stat. "One class at a time" as highlighted lesson.
- Style notes: The "went rogue" detail is the hook — it's honest and memorable. The fix is the takeaway. ~45 words.

## Final Slide — CTA
**Headline:** Ship with AI — Follow for More
**GFE copy:** Practical AI coding tips for engineering teams. Follow GreatFrontEnd for weekly tips.
**CTA button text:** Share This Post & Follow Us!
**Visual direction:**
- Layout: Headline centered. GFE logo prominent. "Ship with AI" series branding.
- Key elements: GFE logo, series badge, CTA text.
- Style notes: Dark bg consistent with series. Clean, minimal.

**Target:** 9 slides (Hook + 7 content + CTA). Ship with AI series post #2.

**Planned first comment:** "One thing that didn't fit in the carousel: Osmani described merging an AI-implemented feature, tests passed, everything looked clean — and 3 days later he couldn't explain how it worked. He calls it 'comprehension debt.' The psychological hook is real: you're always almost there, just one more prompt. One dev reported 'that was 5 hrs ago' on a task that seemed 5 minutes away. The `agents.md` trick from slide 3 is the simplest thing you can try today — create a file that forces your AI to ask questions before coding. It takes 2 minutes and prevents most assumption propagation failures. If you want to sharpen the fundamentals that make AI review possible, GFE's front-end interview questions are a good starting point: https://www.greatfrontend.com/front-end-interview-guidebook?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=ship-with-ai-2_mar+2026.
