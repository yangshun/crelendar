## Source 1: GFE Evaluation Axes
**URL:** https://www.greatfrontend.com/front-end-system-design-playbook/evaluation-axes

6 evaluation axes interviewers use:

1. **Problem Exploration** — Ask clarifying questions, gather functional/non-functional requirements, define scope
2. **Architecture** — Break problem into components, define responsibilities and APIs, practical and extensible solutions
3. **Technical Proficiency** — FE fundamentals, domain depth (perf, networking, a11y, i18n, security, scalability), tradeoff analysis
4. **Exploration & Tradeoffs** — Multiple solutions with pros/cons, explain suitability given context, no "one right answer" mindset
5. **Product & UX Sense** — Loading states, error handling, mobile/keyboard friendliness, recovery strategies
6. **Communication & Collaboration** — Clear and concise, engage interviewer, open to feedback, refine solutions

## Source 2: GFE System Design Prep
**URL:** https://www.greatfrontend.com/questions/formats/system-design

- 19 system design questions (UI Components + Full Applications)
- RADIO Framework: Requirements → Architecture → Data Model → Interface → Optimizations
- 10+ solved questions with detailed solutions
- 11 hours total study time
- Questions: Autocomplete, Modal, News Feed, Pinterest, Netflix, E-commerce, Chat App, etc.
- 3,190+ users completed the News Feed question

## Prior Art in Top Posts
- **System Design Cheatsheet** — Carousel. Practical cheatsheet positioning. Referenced RADIO framework. Save/repost CTAs.
- **Uber Interview Question** — Carousel (6+ slides). Real-world problem challenge. Progressive complexity. Code snippets.

**Gap:** Neither prior post covered the *evaluation criteria* angle — what interviewers actually score on. Both focused on "how to solve" rather than "how you're judged."

## Key Insight
The evaluation axes are the differentiator. Most FE system design content teaches frameworks/approaches. Almost none tells candidates *what interviewers are actually looking for* — which is what this post should do. This is insider knowledge that feels exclusive.

## Potential Angles
1. "The 6 things interviewers actually score you on" — direct, listicle-style
2. "Why your system design answer is technically correct but still fails" — myth-bust angle (focuses on soft axes like communication and UX sense)
3. "The front end system design scoring rubric interviewers won't share" — exclusive/insider angle

## GFE Tie-in
Natural: RADIO framework maps to evaluation axes. CTA to system design prep (19 questions with solutions).
