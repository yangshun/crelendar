🔥 Git Skills That Separate Junior Developers from Senior Ones
Git is more than just commit and push. Here's how your Git game grows as your dev career levels up 👇

🟦 Level 1 – Basic Git (Junior Developers)
Commands: clone, add, commit, push
 🔰 You’re getting familiar with version control. You're mainly working solo or making minor contributions. Mistakes are frequent, but you’re learning the Git basics fast.
🚦 Common Traits: Linear history, few branches, occasional force-push.

🟩 Level 2 – Collaboration Git (Mid-Level Developers)
Commands: branch, merge, pull, resolving conflicts
 🔧 You’re collaborating with others, creating feature branches, and handling merge conflicts. You start using PRs and begin understanding branching strategies.
📌 You’re learning to avoid breaking main. Merge etiquette becomes second nature.

🟨 Level 3 – Advanced Git (Mid-Senior Developers)
Commands: rebase, stash, cherry-pick, bisect
 🧠 You're optimizing history, debugging regressions, and managing multiple patch branches. You know when to use rebase vs. merge and aren’t afraid of Git internals.
🎯 You think in trees. Your commits tell a story.

🟥 Level 4 – Pro Git (Senior+ Developers & Leads)
Concepts: Git Hooks, signed commits, atomic commits, CI/CD integration
 ⚙️ You automate workflows, enforce commit standards, and integrate Git into deployment pipelines. You lead PR reviews and set the standards for your team.
🧩 You don’t just use Git… you engineer workflows around it.

🎯 Why it matters:
Git isn't just about version control, it's about collaboration, clarity, and confidence. Senior devs know Git is a critical tool in scaling code and teams.

Design Brief
🎯 Design Concept
 Use a vertical flowchart or ladder-style graphic to represent progression. Each level illustrates increasing Git proficiency. Arrows can be used to link between each stage of progression. 

📌 Key Elements to Include
	•	Title: "Git Skills That Separate Junior from Senior Devs"

	•	Subtitle: "Git Skills in 4 levels"


	•	A 4-level progression:

	•	Level 1 – Basic Git (Junior): clone, add, commit, push
	•	Description: Basic commands for individual workflow

	•	Level 2 – Collaboration Git (Mid-Level): branch, merge, pull, resolving conflicts
	•	Description: Team collaboration via branching and merge

	•	Level 3 – Advanced Git (Mid-Senior): rebase, stash, cherry-pick, bisect
	•	Description:  Power tools for complex history management

	•	Level 4 – Pro Git (Senior+ & Leads): Git hooks, signed commits, CI/CD integration, atomic commits
	•	Description: Automation and best practices in real-world teams

	•	Each level should have:

	•	An icon for each level. For instance, a toolbox emoji for level 1, arrow emoji to represent branching for level 2, brain for level 3 and gear icon for level 4, etc. 

	•	A suggestion could be that the color for each level could be based on the corresponding emoji colours from the caption (blue -> green -> yellow -> red) to show increasing intensity / difficulty. But if that messes with the consistency for post colours, please feel free to use the same colour schemes for each level.
