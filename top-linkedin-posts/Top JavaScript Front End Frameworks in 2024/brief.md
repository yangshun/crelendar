Infographic Brief
We want to list the top 10 frameworks, along with brief descriptions of them. We can either use a ranking with trend lines like the one below and adjust it to create even spacing between the lines? 

Instead, A cropped trend graph showing the last 3 years of rankings official State of JS 2024 results can be used as screenshotted below. This shows the change in rankings instead of usage %ages. But the advantage of this is that the lines are evenly spaced already so it is easier to put logos and descriptions on the right of the lines.  

A pie chart is also possible where you color code the frameworks and then put logo / description / percentage usage separately on the side. 



The following table lists the framework name, usage, and a very brief description. It also includes a link to the website. Usage percentages are accurate and sourced from https://2024.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/front-end-frameworks/. You may mention this at the end of the infographic.
