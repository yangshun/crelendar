Is Modern Front End Development Really Better? 🤔 Let’s Play Devil’s Advocate.
You’ve probably heard the modern dev gospel:
Modern Front End: Good ✅
Old-School HTML/CSS/JS: Bad ❌
 
And don’t even get started on the "good ol’ days" folks still clinging to jQuery…
But let’s take a step back, is it really that black and white?
We’ve all been there. Today’s front end stacks are supposed to help us build faster, smarter, and more scalable UIs. So:
 • We use React/Vue/Svelte to create reusable components
 • Tailwind or CSS-in-JS gives us utility-first styling
 • TypeScript makes our code safer
 • We build design systems for consistency
 • We optimize performance with lazy loading and SSR/SSG
But what happens when the “real world” hits?
 • You’re debugging hydration mismatches 😩
 • Your component library has 12 slightly different Button variants
 • Need to change a color? Good luck; Tailwind, theme, inline style, or rogue CSS?
 • Simple requests become week-long refactors
 • Your bundle is 1MB+, and you're still the “front end performance guy” 🤡
So what’s really going on?

We say we’re building "clean, scalable, reusable" UI, but often we’re just trying not to break things when marketing wants a new banner by EOD.
The truth?
Sometimes old-school front end was... better.
Write some HTML. Add a stylesheet. Sprinkle in JavaScript.
No build step. No hydration mismatch. No 15-minute cold starts.
That doesn’t mean we throw out the progress.
But let’s stop chasing hype, and start chasing value.
How about you?
Fan of modern stacks, or secretly miss <table> layouts? 😉

P.S. You can still be a great front end engineer, even if you occasionally reach for jQuery 😉
