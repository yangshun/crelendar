Struggling to choose a front‑end framework that actually supports your career growth? Here’s your roadmap, from real criteria to smart decisions.

Selecting a front‑end framework isn’t a popularity contest, it’s a strategic career move. This guide uses objective criteria from roadmap.sh to help you choose between React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, Solid.js, Qwik, and Astro based on what matters to your path.
How it’s implemented
	•	Identify your project type (static site vs interactive app vs performance‑critical)

	•	Evaluate frameworks across 5 dimensions: performance, popularity, learning curve, ecosystem, future‑proofing

	•	Align your shortlist with your career context: freelancer, hobbyist or enterprise developer

	•	Compare top two frameworks in strengths vs weaknesses table

Why it matters for you
 • Avoid wasting time on mismatched tech
 • Position yourself for roles and projects where demand is growing
 • Build a future‑proof skillset tied to active ecosystems and community support
Example framework breakdown
React
 • Strengths: virtual DOM performance, huge ecosystem, job opportunities
 • Weaknesses: boilerplate, complex state handling, potential re‑render pitfalls
Astro
 • Strengths: ultra‑fast static sites, minimal client JavaScript
 • Weaknesses: smaller ecosystem, SSR learning curve
Extra developer tips
 • Test performance with Lighthouse for frameworks you evaluate
 • Follow State of JS surveys to track trends
 • Contribute to active communities like Reactiflux or Svelte Society
 • Reinforce your decision by building mini‑projects in both frameworks
Choose a framework that not only fits your current project but supports your long‑term career vision.
This single‑slide post gives developers a clear action plan (backed by real evaluation criteria) to choose frameworks aligned with their goals, and way beyond hype.

Flowchart center:
	•	**Define your project type**
 • Static/content site → Svelte, Astro
 • SPA/interactive app → React, Vue, Angular
 • Cutting‑edge perf → Solid.js, Qwik
Note to Designer: Use the logos for each of these instead of the names

	•	Framework evaluation criteria (5 colored icons & bullets):

	•	Performance (speedometer logo): load times, render efficiency

	•	Popularity (community/group logo): learning resources, jobs

	•	Learning curve (staircase logo): ramp‑up time

	•	Ecosystem (puzzle logo): libraries, tooling, stability

	•	Future‑proofing (clock‑arrow logo): active maintenance, trends

	•	Match to your career goal: Freelancer/hobbyist vs Enterprise/start‑up

	•	Shortlist two → Strengths vs Weaknesses mini‑table

Example mini‑table:
Framework
Strengths
Weaknesses
React
Massive ecosystem, jobs, virtual DOM perf
Boilerplate, complex state handling
Astro
Fast-load static sites, minimal client JS
Younger ecosystem, SSR edge cases
Note at bottom: Align your choice with role, project goals, and long‑term growth
