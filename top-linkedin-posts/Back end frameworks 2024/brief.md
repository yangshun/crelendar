If you’re using Javascript for generating APIs and managing back-ends, choosing the right framework can impact your development experience, performance, and maintainability. According to the State of JS 2024 report, here are the most popular Javascript backend frameworks that developers are currently using!

	•	ExpressThe industry leader remains dominant with widespread adoption, simplicity, and flexibility. Still the go-to for many Node.js applications.
	•	NestA TypeScript-first framework built for scalability, inspired by Angular’s modular architecture. Great for enterprise-grade applications.
	•	FastifyPrioritizing speed and low overhead, Fastify is optimized for performance while maintaining a great developer experience.
	•	StrapiA headless CMS that makes API creation seamless. Ideal for content-driven applications.
	•	HonoThis lightweight framework runs on multiple JavaScript runtimes like Node.js, Bun, and Cloudflare Workers.
	•	KoaCreated by the same team behind Express, Koa offers a more modern and minimalistic approach to backend development.
	•	ElysiaJSA new, ultra-lightweight framework designed for developer ergonomics with end-to-end type safety.
	•	AdonisThis full-featured, TypeScript-first Node.js framework has a rich set of tools for building scalable backend applications.

Infographic Brief
Original branding: https://stateofjs.com/en-US

See this chart and adapt it for our infographic:

One-page infographic would be ideal, with just the chart. You can use the same bar chart format. But put the logos of each framework next to it. You can find the logos of each in the ‘link’ column of the table below.

Skip the number of users on the right, just use the percentages. The previous State of JS post confused some people because the percentages don’t add up to 100% (since people can select multiple options). Therefore, at the bottom of the diagram, mention this line:
“Usage percentages are based on the multiple response question in the State of JS 2024 survey”

In summary, I’m thinking of a bar chart with the framework name alongside its logo, the bar itself, and the percentage of users next to it. And the disclaimer sentence at the bottom.
