The frontend landscape is evolving fast—and so are the expectations for developers at every level. Whether you're just starting out or aiming for senior and beyond, having a clear roadmap can be the difference between spinning your wheels and leveling up with purpose.
	•	Entry Level Developer:

	•	Core skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git.

	•	Goals: Get comfortable shipping features and fixing bugs.

	•	Mid Level Developer:

	•	Core skills: React/Vue/Angular, API integration, testing (Jest/Cypress), performance optimization, basic accessibility.

	•	Goals: Understand architecture and design patterns. Own features, contribute to planning, mentor juniors.

	•	Senior Developer:

	•	Core skills: System design, state management, CI/CD, advanced performance techniques like SSR/SSG, accessibility at scale.

	•	Goals: Build for scale and maintainability. Drive technical decisions, own cross-team initiatives.

	•	Lead / Front end Architect:

	•	Core skills: Monorepos, micro frontends, cross-functional leadership, design systems, DevOps fluency.

	•	Goals: Strategic thinking. Long-term codebase health. Set vision, lead teams, guide organization-wide frontend strategy.

Where are you on this roadmap? And more importantly—what are you learning next? Let’s discuss below. 
If you're looking for structured training to grow into your next role, our platform is built for that. We have a collection of front end interview prep questions and guides, from vanilla Javascript to system design questions.

Design Brief

	•	Single page infographic presented as a flowchart or stages with arrows between them.
	•	For each stage, include the stage name (entry level, mid level, etc.). 
	•	Create two boxes inside each stage, one for skills and one for goals

Entry Level Developer
	•	HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
	•	Git (version control)
	•	Get comfortable shipping features and fixing bugs
Use generic icons next to each. 

For example, for entry level and mid level you can use HTML, CSS, JS, React, Vue, Angular, Jest logos as relevant.

For senior, you can use Redux or useContent logo

For lead, you can use DevOps icon.

These are not necessary, you can also use some icons showing progression or indicating the level of a stage. Overall though, it should be like an arrow-flowchart from entry level to lead since the idea behind it is of a roadmap.
