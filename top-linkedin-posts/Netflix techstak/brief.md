Behind Netflix’s Tech Stack 🎬
Most developers know Netflix for its slick streaming experience, but beneath the surface lies a powerful stack of tools and frameworks driving performance across web, mobile, and TV.
This lineup highlights Netflix’s commitment to engineering at scale, blending open-source innovation with custom-built solutions that ensure seamless delivery to millions of viewers worldwide.
Each technology here plays a critical role in shaping an interface that feels fast, reactive, and intuitive, no matter what screen you're watching from.

Graphics Brief
We can use a cinematic dashboard or Netflix-style scrolling UI. Each technology appears as a tile or screen on a "film reel" or "TV carousel". Use red (#e50914) and black, Netflix’s signature palette, and optional glowing or spotlight accents behind each tech card. A digital “streaming path” can connect them, like a glowing progress bar.

I’m thinking we can have a Netflix UI like the above, but simplified with just the Netflix logo on the right, and each show replaced with a technology. 
Fallback layout: A clean grid or vertical scroll with tech logos, short descriptions, and tags.

🔧 Brief Notes
	•	Text in [] are tags (e.g. [Frontend]) to display below each tech title

	•	Logos can be pulled from official brand sites or GitHub

	•	Try to mimic Netflix's UI feel, dark, minimal, immersive
