Content Brief

Your Front-End resume is more than a document—it's your first UI. Generic advice often falls short for technical roles.
Here are 3 front-end specific tips to build a resume that gets you past the screeners. 👇
1. Quantify your impact
Go beyond listing tasks. Show results with concrete data.
	•	Instead of: "Built a website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript." 
	•	Try: "Boosted site performance to a 98 Lighthouse score and <2s load time for an e-commerce site with 20k MAU." 
2. Curate your skills
Don't list every library you've ever used. Be strategic.
	•	✅ Prioritize: Technologies from the job description. 
	•	✅ Focus: On key architectural tools (e.g., React, Next.js), not minor utilities. 
	•	❌ Avoid: Listing multiple similar frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, and Vue), as it dilutes your expertise. 
3. Showcase your passion with projects
Prove your skills are current and you're passionate about the field.
	•	List projects using modern technologies. 
	•	Always include links to the live project and your GitHub repository. 
	•	Mention any open-source contributions to stand out.

Design Brief
A 7-slide carousel post (1 Intro slide, 1 outro / CTA, 5 content slides)

Slide 1: Title Slide
	•	Header Text: Ultimate Guide to
	•	Main Title: Front-End Engineer Resumes
	•	Subtitle: Craft a resume that gets you past the screeners and into the interview.
	•	Visuals: A subtle, stylized graphic of a resume document with code-related icons (e.g., < >, { }) integrated into it.
	•	Branding: GreatFrontEnd logo at the bottom.


Slide 2: Formatting For Readability
	•	Title: First Impressions Matter
	•	Subtitle: A clean and well-organized resume is easier for both recruiters and Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to parse.
	•	Content (place this in a side by side comparison layout (like pro-vs-cons columns))
	•	On the left:
	•	Avoid:
	•	Cluttered layouts that are hard to read.
	•	Inconsistent formatting / font styles.
	•	Too many colors.
	•	On the right:
	•	Good Practice: 
	•	Single-column layout. 
	•	Clean, common fonts (Arial, Calibri). 
	•	Minimum 11px font size.
	•	Visuals: A side-by-side comparison. Left side shows a cluttered, unformatted resume with a 👎 icon. Right side shows a clean, single-column resume with a 👍 icon.
	•	These visuals basically go above the content in the two columns 
 <- rough idea


Slide 3: Describe Your Experience
	•	Title: Go from Vague Duties to Quantified Impact
	•	Visuals: A clear "Bad vs. Better" layout (same two column approach as Slide 2)
	•	Left Side (Bad 👎):
	•	Text: "Built a website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript".
	•	Right Side (Better 👍):
	•	Text: "Built a performant e-commerce site with Next.js & GraphQL for 20k MAU, achieving a 98 Lighthouse score and <2s load time".
	•	Footer text (with info icon) as in the example below from v0 post: Follow the STAR method to ensure recruiters can identify your real, specific contributions.


Slide 4: Showcase Key Front End Achievements
	•	Title: Highlight Your Technical Contributions
	•	Layout: Four quadrants grid, each with a title, an icon, and a short description.
	•	Quadrant 1: Performance
	•	Icon: Speedometer/gauge.
	•	Text: "Lighthouse score, page load time, bundle size reduction %".
	•	Quadrant 2: Testing
	•	Icon: Shield with a checkmark.
	•	Text: "% increase in test coverage, number of critical flows tested".
	•	Quadrant 3: Product Work
	•	Icon: Jigsaw puzzle piece.
	•	Text: "Elaborate on features built, describing their scale and complexity".
	•	Quadrant 4: Tooling
	•	Icon: Wrench/gears.
	•	Text: "Modernized tech stack (e.g., jQuery → React), introduced TypeScript".


Slide 5: How to Curate Your Skills
	•	Title: Be Strategic with Your Skills Section
	•	Layout: A four-point list, each with a relevant icon.
	•	1. Match the Job Listing:
 Prioritize skills mentioned in the role you're applying for.
	•	2. Focus on Architecture:
 List key technologies like React or Next.js, not minor utility libraries.
	•	3. Stay Modern:
 Include widely known or popular tools to show you're up-to-date.
	•	4. Show Breadth, But Don’t Draw Yourself Too Thin:
Listing all main frameworks (React, Angular, and Vue) together is usually unnecessary. Focus on the framework required in the job opening.

Slide 6: Prove Your Passion
	•	Title: Show, Don't Just Tell
	•	Subtitle: Personal projects are proof that you love what you do and keep your skills sharp.
	•	Layout: 3 points arranged in a listicle format around a centre rectangle:
	•	Centre Rectangle: “Prove Your Passion”
	•	Listicle Item 1: List projects using modern technologies not used in your day job.
	•	Listicle Item 2: Include live links and a link to your GitHub.
	•	Listicle Item 3: Mention open-source contributions if you have them.
	•	Visuals: Use relevant icons / visuals for each listicle item. 
	•	For modern technologies (item 1), use Vite, Redux, Vercel logos.
	•	For github (item 2), use Github visuals / logo.
	•	For open source (item 3), use “git push”, “git pull” code snippets to give the idea of open source contributions.

Slide 7: Call to Action (CTA)
	•	Main Text: Ready to Ace the Interview?
	•	Body Text: Your resume is just the first step. GreatFrontEnd has the resources you need to master the front-end interview and coding assessments.
	•	CTA: Follow us for more expert tips, practice questions, and career guides.
