🚀 Front-end is moving fast — picking the right meta-framework can make or break your project.
Meta-frameworks handle how apps are rendered and served, and they’re now essential in modern web dev.

	•	Next.js: Long-standing leader; excels in server-side rendering and static site generation with top performance.
