Redux or Zustand?
This decision will either accelerate your development workflow by 40% or trap you in unnecessary complexity for months.

Redux = Enterprise Power. Strict patterns, unbeatable debugging tools, predictable state flows.
Perfect when your app has complex business logic and your team needs structure that scales. Still powers 78% of enterprise React apps for good reason.

Zustand = Developer Happiness. 1KB bundle, zero boilerplate, hook-based simplicity. Write state, use state, ship features. Adoption jumped 41% in 2025 because developers finally found their sweet spot between power and simplicity.

The math is simple:
	•	Complex app with 5+ developers → Redux
	•	Medium app with speed priorities → Zustand
	•	Need time-travel debugging → Redux
	•	Want to prototype fast → Zustand

Both libraries work. The difference is whether you're optimizing for team coordination or development velocity.

Your project scale and team dynamics should drive the choice, not popularity contests. Which path matches your next project? Drop a comment with your choice and reasoning - let's see what the community is actually using in 2025.

Design Brief
Format: 5 paged static post
(Also include an intro slide and CTA slide). These 3 are the content slides

Intro Slide:
Title: Redux vs Zustand

First Content Slide:
Logos above each respective side of the table
Redux: https://redux.js.org/img/redux-logo-landscape.png
Zustand: 


Second Slide:
Title: “Scenario 1: Small-to-Medium SaaS Dashboard”
Team size: 3 developers
Application complexity: Medium, with 20-30 screens
State characteristics: Mostly UI state, some server cache
Best choice: Zustand
Rationale: Simple API, low boilerplate, good performance, and enough structure for a small team

A simple logo showing a small team or company at the top will do.

Third Slide:
Title: “Scenario 2: Large Enterprise Application”
Team size: 15+ developers across multiple teams
Application complexity: High, with 100+ screens and complex workflows
State characteristics: Complex domain model, lots of shared state, audit requirements
Best choice: Redux (RTK)
Rationale: Strict patterns, excellent debugging, middleware ecosystem, and established patterns for large teams

A simple logo showing a big company at the top will do 

CTA Slide:
	•	Usual CTA slide to visit greatfrontend to find out more
