Front End System Design Cheatsheet
Post Content
Most people treat cheatsheets like lucky charms.
They save them... and never look again 😅
But this one? Use it right — and it'll help you land the job.
Here’s how 👇
✅ Understand what each term means, when it’s useful, and what tradeoffs are involved
✅ Deepen your knowledge — explore each topic at greatfrontend.com
✅ Recite the sections & components daily until they flow: Architecture → State → APIs → Performance     → UX…
✅ Apply a framework like RADIO (Requirements exploration, Architecture / High-level design, Data Model / Core Entities, Interface Definition / API, Optimisations and Deep Dive) to structure your answers during interviews
✅ Deliver your answer with clarity and confidence — no buzzword bingo 💥

🎯 Pro tip: During the interview, don’t list everything.
 Scan the cheat sheet in your mind, pick the relevant bits, and explain them with context.
