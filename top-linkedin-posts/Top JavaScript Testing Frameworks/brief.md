🚀 Selecting the right testing framework can significantly impact your project's reliability and development speed.

Testing frameworks shape how efficiently you catch bugs, maintain code quality, and deliver robust user experiences, making them essential in modern web development.
According to the State of JS 2024, these are the top 13 testing frameworks by usage across the industry. 👇

	•	Cypress: Powerful end-to-end testing tool known for interactive debugging and real-time reloading.

Previous meta frameworks post ^

	•	The format of this earlier post of ours on meta frameworks can be used.
	•	Just change the  “Usage %age” label to “Usage” as percentage will be implied by the bars.
	•	Icons and Logos: Incorporate official logos for each testing framework. You should be able to find these using the links in the table below.
	•	You can theme anyway you feel appropriate as you are already familiar with State of JS posts and which performed well. The last one on meta frameworks did really well so I suggest using that format but change up the color theme from pink hues so users dont confuse it with the earlier post.
	•	All percentages I’ve mentioned are accurate and official according to the following source:
